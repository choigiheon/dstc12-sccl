So, what we can do about that is we can either offer a charge back, so that would reimburse you the money or what we can also do, to make sure that there's no continued fraud on your account, is we can send you a new credit card and cancel that one.", 'OK. So, would you like to dispute this?', "OK. So, you're trying to use your debit card and it's declining and did you want to check the balance on your account?", "OK. Sorry that you're having that issue. So, let's just make sure that I understand you correctly. So, you're having some issues with your account and you need to speak to someone in person. So, you need me to locate a branch near you?", 'OK. Thank you and before you know I go I would like to dispute a couple of transactions I see on my checking account.', "OK. Thank you very much for that. And so you're calling because of a disputed transaction?", "OK. That makes sense. But with the information that you've given me it does seem like your card may have been compromised and we will need to cancel that card and send you a new one.", 'OK. That sounds good. One last thing I need to do before I get off the phone with you is I need to change my my street address.', 'OK. That sounds great. can you tell me if the if my checking account receives any interest?', 'OK. That sounds great. can you tell me what the hours of the branch is and what days they are open?', "OK. That that shouldn't be a problem I could suggest that you go to a nearby branch if you're OK with that.", "OK. That's good because I did lose the card and I haven't been able to find it. So, that will make is so no one can use the card. Is that correct or do I need to go through a whole new process with that?", "OK. That's good though right now I want to know about my account balance. What's in my account? Do I still have money? I I don't know because right now I'm tired.", "OK. That's not bad. and I know I have bank credit card with you guys. What's the credit limit do I have on that?", "OK. There we go. Yeah. I was I was a little thrown off. OK. Thank you. I was trying to find a nearest ATM You know, again, I the I go to ATMs and I get charged a service fee. I was trying to find one in my area where I don't get charged a service fee.", 'OK. Two hundred six dollars and fifty-three cents. OK. Thank you for that and up would also like to make a wire transfer if I could.', "OK. Well I was I was calling because I'm actually I haven't and been able to have access on my phone for some reason . I'm not getting any bars where I am. and I need to transfer some money from my savings over to my checking so I have access to some money out here.", "OK. Well OK. I can make that nearest one but it sounds like I'll be there after close. Is there at least a deposit slip or deposit you know drop box that I can make my deposit in there since it's after hours?", "OK. Well in my eyes, you're Intellibank, so so all right so I I have major problem. I am from the Philadelphia area. I am traveling out of town. I'm in Nashville and I need a actual bank location so I can go. I have some banking things I need to take care of. Some deposits, withdrawals, some checks, and I I just have a lot of situations I need to take care of in person not you know at an ATM or whatever. So is there a local bank to my location? I'm having trouble finding one.", 'OK. Well there are a number of alternatives for nearby branches. I can can I help you find a branch?', 'OK. Well, is there anyway you could move some money around for me before we hang up?', 'OK. Well, thank you so much. I really appreciate it. while I have you is it possible to check my my account balance?', 'OK. Where is your Intellicheck bank located?', "OK. While you have my account open can you tell just to make sure that I don't have anything pending to come out right now. I just don't want my account to be over drafted, that's all.", 'OK. Would you like me to transfer funds into another account while we have this account locked?', 'OK. Would you like me to update the address on your account?', 'OK. Would you like us to replace a card?', "OK. Yeah deposit slips that's what I was thinking of. I'm sorry it slipped my mind. that's perfect. Then yes, I just need to know where the nearest ATM is then.", "OK. Yeah, so, if you would like, I could provide you with the closest branch to where you're going to be at. Or, I could also provide you with the next closest branch, by your, your house.", "OK. Yeah. I I see that, that will be cleared in two days. So if you'd like, you could would you like to transfer some money from another account to help cover this?", "OK. Yeah. Well I'll be happy you help you locate a branch near wherever you might be. If you would, let me ask, what is the street address that you're at so that I can pull up a branch near there?", "OK. Yes, but I also noticed something. I have a some charges here on my phone. from from my accounts. You know, I just found out that you guys have been charging me. I don't know what's this charge is all about you know, so can you explain that to me, please?", 'OK. Yes, through email please.', "OK. by the way, I I I I want to just check on one thing. On my address I if you could check on that I may have used. I may have given you Dogwood Street. seven fifty-three Dogwood Street here in Phoenix. It's it's actually seven fifty-three Dogwood Road.", 'OK. can we set that two-factor authentication can we go ahead and set that up today?', 'OK. can you tell me the closest ATM to my address?', 'OK. can you transfer five hundred dollars from my savings account to my checking account? That should be enough to buy those tires.', 'OK. could you direct me to the closest branch near my address?', 'OK. could you just give me a quick balance on that account please?', 'OK. is that something that you could help me get set up today?', "OK. so last night me and my friends. We were coming out of the club. And we were going to my car in the parking lot and we were robbed at gun point. And the the the person stole my wallet and got my credit card and and I I I even they took the keys. They didn't take my car but they took my key. Like I'm I'm just a mess. I don't know what to do right now.", "OK. so what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna cancel this card.", "OK. the other thing I'd like to know is about getting some new checks with my new address on.", "OK. well, I'm over here at twelve twelve North Shore Lane. is there a branch near here?", 'OK. what are the hours of the first one you gave me on Cherry Street?', 'OK. when will I receive my checks?', 'OK. while I got you on the phone, could you check my balance?', "Of course, yes. Once you block that one, I want to get a new card that I'll be able to withdraw. I need a new card.", 'Oh I need to check the available balance in my account.', "Oh I see. I see. OK well the reason why I'm calling is I wanna make a transfer of some money from my checking account to my savings account.", 'Oh I was wondering where your nearest branch location is?', "Oh I'd like to report a lost or stolen credit card.", "Oh I'm doing great thank you. The reason that I am calling I was going to see if I could do an internal transfer and transfer some money from my checking account into my savings account.", "Oh I'm good I just have to do a few changes on my account.", "Oh I'm sorry, did I say four thousand? I actually only wanted two thousand. Is there any way that you can transfer two thousand back?", 'Oh Miss Darleen. Before we hang up, I can also give you information about our online banking to setup your account that way as well.', 'Oh OK I just picked up the first phone that it came up on Google. Where are you exactly located so I can see like how far are you from me?', 'Oh OK and I would like to open a new account.', "Oh OK great. I actually would like to since that balance it it actually is a little bit more than I thought. I'd like to transfer five hundred dollars over to my savings account. do you think you could help me with that?", 'Oh OK if we can update that please to my new address', "Oh OK perfect. I was wondering also if you could help me find a branch near me that's open. I I am having some problems accessing that information on my phone.", "Oh OK yeah that should be easy to remember. One five seven Mouse Street. OK Oh and you know there's something else that I need to do. I I can't believe I left this to the end. I need to report my credit card stolen.", "Oh OK yeah. I'll head in there. What are your hours?", "Oh OK. All right. Well I mean I mean right at this moment I I'm actually trying to find one of your branches not an ATM but a branch where I can walk in and speak with somebody. can you tell me where the nearest branch is to where I'm located right now?", 'Oh OK. I think I know where that is. does it have a daily withdrawal limit at that ATM?', 'Oh OK. If we can would you be able to update that or do I need to go online?', 'Oh OK. That That works great. That should be enough for me I think. and you said and are the ATM hours the same as the lobby hours there?', "Oh OK. That actually makes sense. so I'll definitely do that. Moving forward I'll. I'll take a look and try to get the app and see if I can keep an eye on my balances but while I do have you on the phone, could I ask for another favor and for you to check my savings account balance?", "Oh OK. Well that's awesome, great. well I would like to make a wire transfer. that was why I was trying to, you know, access it online or what ever. I'm not even sure if I can do that on the website but but now that I have you, if you could help me with that I need to make a wire transfer to to my mom's account. She has an account with you all as well. she's done had several things go on and a couple dental issues and now you know money has gotten super tight. So I need to go ahead and transfer some money over to her account.", "Oh OK. if it can be updated to my new address that's what I would like to do.", "Oh OK. if it's possible I'd like to update that to my current address.", 'Oh OK. is there any way you can transfer three thousands from my savings to my checkings? I just wanna make sure I have enough.', "Oh and while we're on the phone I need to order a new debit card. Mine is snapped in half.", "Oh by the way, the reason I called. I'm locked out of my my online my app and the website, which is why I didn't do the transfer that way. Is there is there any way you can help me to reset that password?", "Oh can, when we're done with that, can I check the balance on my savings I just want to make sure that kinda running low on funds and I want to make sure that I'm good until my next paycheck.", 'Oh gosh, I I need to get some of that trans. Can I can I transfer about seven thousand of that from my checking into my savings ?', "Oh great OK thank you that's very helpful. So how do I start my set up my checking account how do I get started with that?", "Oh hello, This is Charlene and I was and I was in a bit of a fix because I am a bit far from where I'm used to and I was hoping you could help me locate a nearby branch", 'Oh how wonderful. Well, in that case. I I want to open an account with Interbank.', "Oh man that's nanners I'm going on vacation. Is there any way to expedite this like can I get it quicker cuz I'm gonna be like jet setting off to the Caribbean.", 'Oh my day is going quite well, thank you. is there anything else that I can do for you today? Would you like to learn about our online banking services?', "Oh my goodness . I've gotta get to the store today before they close. But before I get there I gotta check something on my Intellibank account and I think I should do that in person. Do you think you can help me with that?", "Oh my goodness I'm so sorry to hear that. If you would like I can actually help find an ATM close to you.", "Oh my goodness. I didn't know you were open that late. OK yes I'd like a late branch.", "Oh no no thanks right now. I I just don't have the time. I need to head to the store before they close and get what I need. but I might swing by later when I'm free. is there any way that I could also come into the bank and set it up if I need to?", "Oh no wait yes actually I might need to go in at some point in time. what's the your local branch hours?", "Oh no! I've gotta have this right away because I don't have transportation to work.", "Oh obviously, no problem. so what do I do to go ahead and be able to access my my app or the website again? Cuz I think that's where my problem started.", "Oh perfect all right that's that's good that didn't yeah that'd be great I appreciate that. You know like if I last time I called I I I've been calling every time I have to check the account balance but it's I just don't like I have to find your number and everything, so I was wondering is is there anyway I can check online?", 'Oh really? can you possibly give me the website so I can sign up for that?', 'Oh thank you and I need to pick a bank and open a new bank account.', "Oh thanks and And so anyways, now I'm in a new neighborhood and I need to find an ATM near me and can you help me with that?", "Oh that's fine you can rush it. I appreciate that.", "Oh that's just wonderful, thank you so much for explaining that for me. can you by chance is there a local branch that has twenty-four hour ATM services near my home?", 'Oh uh I need uh the check the account balance in my checking.', 'Oh we can set you up the first your online banking and to make it easier for you.', "Oh well that's wonderful, thank you so much for doing that. I did have one more question. I did give you my address could you possibly tell me the nearest local branch from my home?", "Oh wonderful wonderful wonderful. Do you by any chance offer any kind of loans at your bank? Like an auto loan. I was trying to get a loan for my daughter but she looks like she gonna need some help, so we're willing to help finance the car but we need to get approved for an amount. Do y'all offer that at your bank?", "Oh wow sir. OK. That happens sometimes I understand. So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to put a block on this card right now so you won't even if you did find it for some reason or locate it you would not be able to use it. Or if somebody else found it they wouldn't be able to use it. So let me block that right now.", "Oh wow, oh my God. I really wanted to to deposit a check online through my phone I live out in the desert area so it's like hard for me to get to the bank. The closest bank is like literally far out. but anyway, I'm gonna give you my ZIP code. Hopefully you find something. the ZIP code is one zero sixteen one nine zero sixteen, sorry about that.", "Oh yeah I habye bye, I have one more I need help finding the nearest ATM near me.

The actual reason that I'm calling is, I'm trying to find a branch near me . The apartment that we were living in, we had a branch that was right around the corner, all I had to do if I need to go to the bank was walk out the door and there we were.", 'Oh!

Now, the reason I'm calling, my brother, he's in the Airforce and him and his wife and my nephew, they now live all the way up in Dover. And you know of course, we're down here in Georgia. But, I would love to be able to try to get some money out to my brother so he can get my nephew a present from me for his birthday since I won't be able to visit. And I was calling to see if you guys do anything like that. And also, if you do, would there be any kind of charge that's actually why I'm calling you guys, cuz Western Union is so expensive. I really don't want to use them so I figured I'd give you you guys a call first.", "Oh, I'm doing just fine. Thank you very much. The reason that I'm calling, my sister, she has been out of work. So, I was going to see if it would be possible for me to send some money from my checking account over to hers? She actually also banks with Intellibank,", "Oh, I'm great thank you.

I thought maybe you could help me with that.", 'Oh, it said my password was wrong.', "Oh, no, that's OK. I yes, there is something else I do want to I wanted to do. I was trying to do it online and as I said, I was having an issue. I saw a charge out there for a service that was not rendered. it was actually for something that was supposed to be scheduled and it was wasn't rendered the person it was a charge from Home Depot and the person never came out to fix my dishwasher. And I called them and they said they were going to reverse the charge and they still haven't and so I want to dispute that through you guys because they are not taking care of removing the charge from my my account.", 'Oh, no. I am so sorry to hear that. I can definitely help you with ordering a replacement card.', "Oh, no. Not with traffic the way it is midtown. hey what's the nearest branch?", "Oh, oh!

Anyway, I already received on my new address a letter from you guys that there's a problem with my checking account. Can you tell me what's going on?", "Oh, thanks. what I'm looking for, I need to find the nearest ATM.", "Oh, that's wonderful. Thank you so much for taking your time and gimme that, and I'm so thankful that I'm able to order the checks over the phone. This is so much more easier for me. my husband was wondering if we can possibly do a I believe it's called a internal transfer?", 'Oh, those are such bad rates for both of those option. I will like to continue with opening a new account.', "Oh, well, I must be thinking of a different account somewhere else. But I don't want to use Intellibank for this purchase. so I would need to open a checking account then, right?", "Oh, yeah, right, sorry, of course, my manners. It says something about the bank's gonna be closed for a couple days?", 'Oh, yeah. Great. Thank you.', 'Oh, yes a checking account would be very helpful.', "Oh, yes, sure. Not a problem.

Actually there is a Joe's Grocery closer to me than than that that other ATM. Does it have a daily withdraw limit?", 'Oh. Oh. Wait wait wait. I need you to check my account balance.', "Oh. That's wonderful. may I suggest we open a checking account to get started? Does that sound OK?", "Ooh that's not gonna be enough I don't think to buy those four wheeler tires Can you transfer money from my well lemme lemme check my savings account balance.", 'Or you can access the the account information so that you could set up your new PIN. They usually send you that information. Did you want more information about going to your account online, sir? We do have online banking.', 'Perfect. And did you want some information on our online banking so that way you can check the account balance yourself?', "Perfect. OK that's great. And can you go ahead and check the savings for me too?", "Perfect. OK, and I'm assuming that you're gonna wanna have a credit card, debit card you know, bank card.", "Real quick cuz I'm I'm only on lunch break for like an hour, is there a bank branch nearby?", "Right right. Need the gas pedal. Hit the gas. well I need your help please finding an ATM. my phone is is actually dead and I need some help finding the ATM. I have a ZIP code here.

OK, can I check my balance when we're done?", 'She does and so does my son, maybe we can also transfer some money to him. Can this be done if I set up an online banking or does it have to be done only through you guys?', 'Should I go ahead and get my checks addresses changed over also?', "So I don't really know what to do about that. I'm just worried about my money getting used. so I want to get the money out of my credit card and put it in another bank so that if it is lost and someone tries to use it there is no credit available to use. Does that make sense?", "So I have a flier from Intellibank that says you have a bunch of new locations opening up and I'm wondering if they're any closer to me than the one that I currently go to. just based on the slide. It looked like you had some that maybe, maybe in the midzone.", "So I received a letter in the mail from Intellibank and it was thanking me for opening a business account. But I didn't open a business account, so I don't really know what's going on.", "So I think I might have lost it or like left it in the ATM somewhere. I'm not really sure but I just can't find it.", 'So I want to apply for an auto loan.', "So I was just thinking. I was thinking back to when I was a kid and you know like I said fourth of July is coming up this weekend. And we all know once fourth of July hits, Christmas is around the corner. And when I was a kid my my aunt and my everybody in my family, my mom and everybody but my aunt would organize it every year. She used to call it, it was she would set up Christmas club accounts for us. I wanna get. I wanna set up I don't know if they still call it that or whatever, but I want to set up an account and this way every week, I can just you know go and transfer money from from my one account to my this new account. This way I have money come you know which I'll probably wait till the last minute to do my Christmas shopping. So this way I can get you know my wife and my kids and my you know I have grandkids. I can be ahead of the curve financially and ready to make all those nice purchases.", "So I'd like to get a replacement.", "So I'm going to cancel your your lost card and I'm going to re-issue a new one. the address I have on file for your account is one two zero Vassel Street. is this your is this correct, sir? Is this your home address?", "So actually it seems, I don't know if it was either lost or stolen, but my ATM card is missing.", "So all right. So I'm a customer at your bank and actually my business partner is on a. It's kind of like a business trip. We own a sports collectibles business and he went out to this convention in Las Vegas and I gave him X amount of dollars and now he's telling me about all these great buys. And I want to give him more money. I don't know if I'm right or wrong but I want to give him more money to get these hopefully good buys.", "So far. Listen, I called and spoke with Natalie earlier about opening a new account, but didn't have all the information available. Is she available, ma'am? Or can you help me?", 'So for the bill payment, we can do an internal transfer.', 'So just a couple of so there has been a couple of charges that I do not remember. Could I just go ahead and get a new card sent out to me and just get this as you know.', 'So with that being said I just have a couple more questions for you. OK, would you like to open a savings account today?', 'So yeah I guess getting him set up online banking would probably be good as well.', "So yes let's check the balance and while you're doing it please take a look to see if there's any indication or notice on in of some sort of issue. Whatever.", 'So you would like open a new account at this bank?', 'So, Intel Bank will send me a new card and I should have it within a week.', 'So, can you tell if the Dollar Tree was the last charge on the card? Hopefully nobody else has been using it.', "So, now that I have this information from you, is there do ybye bye, would you like me to help you set up an, your online account? Is that something you'd like to do today?", 'Someone. I lost my credit card or someone stole it and I need to talk to somebody.', "Sometime soon, I just didn't know if I was talking with someone I can make an appointment with or if I needed to call someone else. I would like to do this all online I just don't know how to set it all up.", 'Sorry. I forgot to also ask you. Tiffany, right? Can you check my balance as well?', 'Sounds good. Can I go ahead and order a box of checks or do I need to wait for it to be open?', 'Such a frustration and so I know I hate. You know I got you on the phone. I wonder if we could get a bank. My bank balance. My my credit card. My not credit card. My checking account balance.', "Sure I just couldn't change my address. Things were going wrong on the app.", 'Sure absolutely. It is two six one nine eight two four seven eight. And after you get that transferred, could I check the the available balances in both. Or I guess the new balances for both of those accounts?', 'Sure you can give me my savings balance if you will the one with the added money.', 'Sure, no problem. I really hope I could get the rate locked for the next twelve months.', "Sure. Don't worry about my account. I just received some information on a document that needs to be provided. I honestly don't understand what this is for or what it's about.", "Sure. and also I wanted to see if you could tell me what the balance of both accounts are. once you're done all that.", 'Thank Mr. Johnson. I did wanna ask you, would you like any further information about setting up an online banking in order to transfer funds more conveniently in the future?', 'Thank you so much for correcting my error in pronunciation. Yes, it would be better help me to find a branch close to me.', 'Thank you, thank you. I need to make a wire transfer.', "Thank you, thank you. We need it. Send help. Ice, air conditioning didn't help. Oh, I am calling today to open an account with you guys.", "Thank you. Also, my app didn't work the other day. Is there a problem with it?", 'Thank you. I also need to make a wire transferral.', "Thank you. I dropped my phone, it broke and I had to get new a new phone and I forgot all my passwords.
